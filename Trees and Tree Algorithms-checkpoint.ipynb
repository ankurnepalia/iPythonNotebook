    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "* To understand what a tree data structure is and how it is used.\n",
    "* To see how trees can be used to implement a map data structure\n",
    "* To implement trees using a list\n",
    "* To implement trees using classes and references\n",
    "* To implement trees as recursive data structures\n",
    "* To implement a priority queue using a heap\n",

    "### Examples of Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trees are used in many areas of computer science, including Operating Systems, graphics, database systems, computer networking and machine learning.\n",
    "* A tree data structure has a root, branches, and leaves.\n",
    "* Trees are hierarchical. By hierarchical, we mean that trees are structured in layers with the **more general thing near the top** and **more specific things near the bottom**.\n",
    "* At each level of the tree, we can ask questions and follow the path that agrees with our answer. \n",
    "* All the children of one node are independent of the children of another node. \n",
    "* Each leaf node is **unique**. \n",
    "* Important property of tree, you can move entire sections of a tree(called a **subtree**) to a different position in the tree without affecting the lower levels of the hierarchy.\n",
    "* Tree examples: \n",
    "    * Bilological classification of animals\n",
    "    * File system: directories or folders are structured as a tree.\n",
    "    * A web page: Each of the html tags used to create the page represents a tree. The HTML source code and the tree accompanying the source illustrates another hierarchy. Notice that each level of the tree corresponds to a level of nesting inside the HTML tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vocabulary and Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Node**: A node is fundamental part of a tree. It can have a name, which we call the **\"key\"**. A node may also have a **\"payload\"**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Edge**: An edge connects two nodes to show that there is a relationship between them. Every node(*except the root*) is connected by exactly one incoming edge from another node. Each node may have several outgoing edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Root**: The root of the tree is the only node in the tree that has no incoming edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Path**: A path is an ordered list of nodes that are connected by edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Children**: The set of nodes c that have incoming edges from the same node to are said to be the children of that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parent**: A node is the parent of all the nodes it connects to with outgoing edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sibling**: Nodes in the tree that are children of the same parent are said to be siblings. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Subtree**: A subtree is a set of nodes and edges comprised of a parent and all the descendants of that parent. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Leaf Node**: A leaf node is a node that has no children.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Level**: The level of a node **n** is the **number of edges** on the path from the **root node to n**. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Height**: The height of a tree is equal to the **maximum level of any node** in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Definition of a Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges that connect paris of nodes. A tree has following properties:\n",
    "* One node of the tree is designated as the root node\n",
    "* Every node n, except the root node, is connected by an edge from exactly one other node p, where p is the parent of n.\n",
    "* A unique path traverses from the root to each node\n",
    "* If each node in the tree has a maximum of two children, we say that the tree is a **binary tree**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second Definition of a Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree is either empty or consists of a root and zero or more subtrees, each of which is also a tree. The root of each subtree is connected to the root of the parent tree by an edge. \n"
