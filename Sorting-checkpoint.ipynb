    "    * Sorting list of words alphabetically or by length\n",
    "    * Sorting list of cities by population, by area, or zip codes\n",
    "* Like searching, the efficiency of a sorting algorithm is related to the number of items being processed. \n",

    "    * First, it will be necessary to compare two values to see which is smaller or larger. In order to sort a collection, some systematic way is needed to compare values to see if they are out of order. **Total number of comparisons** will be the most common way to **measure** a sort procedure.\n",
    "    * Second, when values are not in correct position with respect to one another, it may be necessary to **exchange them**. This exchange is a **costly operation** and the total number of exchanges will also be important for evaluating the overall efficiency of the algorithm. "

    "* The **quick sort** uses **divide and conquer** to gain the same advantage as the merge sort, while **not using additional storage**.\n",
    "    * <font color='red'>Disadvantage: If the list is not divided in half, we will see that the performance is diminished</font>\n",
    "* A quick sort first selects a value, which is called the **pivot value**.  Although there are many ways to choose the pivot value, we will simply use the **first item in the list**. \n",
    "* Role of the pivot value is to assist with spliting the list.\n",
    "* The actual position where the pivot value belongs in the final sorted list, commonly called the **split point**, will be used to divide the list for subsequent calls to the quick sort. \n",
    "* After choosing the pivot value, **partition** process will happen next. Pivot value will help in finding the split point and at the same time move other items to the appropriate side of the list, either less than or greater than the pivot value.\n",
    "* Partitioning begins by locating **two position markers**. The **leftmark** and **rightmark** and the begining and end of the remaining items (excluding pivot value) in the list.\n",
    "* **Goal of the partition process** is to move items that are on the wrong side with respect to the pivot value while also, **converging on the split point**. \n",
    "    * We begin by incrementing **leftmark** until we locate a value that is greater than the pivot value. \n",
    "    * We then decrement **rightmark** until we find a value that is less than the pivot value. \n",
    "    * At this point we have discovered two items that are out of place with respect to the eventual split point. \n",
    "    * Now we can **exchange** these two items and then repeat the process again.\n",
    "    * At the point where **rightmark** becomes less than **leftmark**, we stop. The position of the **rightmark is the split point**.\n",
    "    * The **pivot value** can be **exchanged** with the contents of the **split point** and the pivot value is now in place. \n",
    "    * The list can now be divided at the split point and the quick sort can be invoked **recursively** on the two hlaves. "
